# MannLabs

We develop open-source software for MS-based proteomics, driven by teams at the [Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/mann) and the [Centre for Proteomics Research (Copenhagen)](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/proteomics/mann/).

Our aim is to provide flexible and future-proof tools for proteomics that span the full data analysis pipeline -- from efficient access to raw MS data, through peptide and protein identification and quantification, to biological interpretation and multi-omics integration. We pursue this through:

- **Open science**: all software is released under permissive open-source licenses  
- **Reproducibility and scientific quality**: performant, well-tested, and well-documented methods  
- **Accessibility**: clear APIs, tutorials, and contribution guidelines  
- **Community collaboration**: tools designed to be extensible and interoperable
